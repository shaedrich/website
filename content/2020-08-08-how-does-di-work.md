## Why?

One of the most common things I hear from people who are new to Ember,
new to programming in general, or coming from another frontend ecosystem
(especially React and Vue), is that they think Ember's dependency injection
system is too complicated and magical --
too hard to reason about or know where the injected services come from.
I, too, was in that boat -- until I really dove into how it works -- it was
then that I began to understand why dependency injection even exists, and
how it's actually _simpler_ than _not_ having it at all.

## What is Dependency Injection?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)

> *dependency injection* is a technique in which an object receives other
> objects that it depends on.

_That's it_.

So... this is dependency injection?

```js
let foo = new Foo()

let bar = new Bar(foo);
```

yes!.

The big deal with dependency injection usually comes from _managing_ how an object
receives those other objects.


## Why use Dependency Injection?

For me personally, there are two reasons:
1. Application State (data and functions) can be easily shared between components
2. Testing is much easier and can be done in isolation

For #1, there are many ways to share state between components, but I like that
dependency injection provides a centralized pattern and location for that state
as well as an ergonomic and light way to interact with that state.

For #2, this is a little harder to boil down to a sentence or two, and ultimately
comes down overall architecture of your app, how big your app is, and what sorts of
things provide value when tested. For example, let's say you have some behavior
for interacting with an external API, maybe it's the [Star Wars JSON api](https://swapi.dev/),
or maybe it's interacting with a game that you're building a bot for -- you _could_
build all that functionality into your component(s) -- because why prematurely abstract?
But you could also build that functionality into a _Service_, or "just another
class that your component will end up using", like this:

```js
class MyComponent {
  constructor() {
    this.api = new StarWarsApi();
  }
}

let myComponent = new MyComponent();
```

This is a great first step! as the `StarWarsApi` can be tested by itself without
needing to be tied to your component. _However_, your component has the opposite
problem, it is _dependent_ on the `StarWarsApi`, and there is no way to test
the behaviors of `MyComponent` without using the real implementation of `StarWarsApi`.
The solution to this is dependency injection, where the coupling between the
specific implementation of `StarWarsApi` is reduced to just the interface
(the list of methods that we care about), and during testing, we can swap out
the `StarWarsApi` with a fake one that has all the same methods.

```js
class MyComponent {
  constructor(api) {
    this.api = api;
  }
}

let fakeApi = { /* fake stuff here */ }
let myComponent = new MyComponent(fakeApi);
```

There is _a lot_ of information on this topic, and I think [this StackOverflow Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14301496)
summarizes it well:

Which reminds me of the whole point of software engineering and architecture in
general: _to make testing easier._

If we do not learn from the mistakes of those before us and allow ourselves to make
testing hard for both our coworkers as well as our future selves, we are doing
our coworkers (and ourselves!) a disservice.

This could easily go on a tangent about the important and philosophy of testing
and testing-driven architecture, but that's a topic for another time.


## How does Dependency Injection work in Ember?

I think the best way to describe this is to first demonstrate how we would create
our own dependency injection system from scratch.

This is a bottom-up approach, meaning that we start with the bare minimum, and the
gradually add more behavior as we move forward. First, we'll need to define some
terms and set goals, so we're on the same page:

Nomenclature:
- Service: a named bucket of state and/or behavior (usually a class instance);
- Injection: the act of defining a reference to a Service
- Container: the object that holds references to each Service

Goals:
1. A Service can be referenced from anywhere, regardless of where it is accessed
2. A Service is a [singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)
3. Services can reference each other (circular dependencies are valid)
4. Access to the global namespace is not allowed



This could be considered an ancestor to dependency injection, where there exists
a shared `container` object in the module scope, still allowing for us to
achieve the first three goals.


```ts
// app.js
let container = {};

function bootApp() {
  initializeServices();

  container.bot.begin();
}

class Bot {
  begin() {
    let nextMove = container.ai.getMove();

    container.ui.sendKeyPress(nextMove);
  }
}

function initalizeServices() {
  container.ai = new AI();
  container.bot = new Bot();
  container.ui = new UI();
}


bootApp();
```

In a multi-file environment we don't have access to the same module scope between files,

```ts
// app.js
import Bot from './bot';
import AI from './ai';
import UI from './ui';

let container = {};

function bootApp() {
  initializeServices();

  container.bot.begin();
}

function initializeServices() {
  container.ai = new AI(container);
  container.bot = new Bot(container);
  container.ui = new UI(container);
}

// bot.js
export default class Bot {
  constructor(container) {
    this.container = container;
  }

  begin() {
    let nextMove = this.container.ai.getMove();

    this.container.ui.sendKeyPress(nextMove);
  }
}

```
To see this code in action, view [this CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/dependency-injection-2-b0qws)

However, as a framework or library developer, forcing users / application developers
to remember to assign the container each time isn't very ergonomic.

```ts
// app.js
// same as before

// service.js
export default class Service {
  constructor(container) {
    this.container = container;
  }
}

// bot.js
import Service from './service';

export default class Bot extends Service {
  begin() {
    let nextMove = this.container.ai.getMove();

    this.container.ui.sendKeyPress(nextMove);
  }
}
```

This is a little better, we have abstracted away a bit of boilerplate, but there is still
a "magic property", `container` -- this is generally where object oriented programming
can get a negative reputation for -- a lack of _proper_ or _incomplete_ abstraction.

> _A bad abstraction is worse than no abstraction_

So, let's clean that up a bit using a [decorator](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-decorators)

```ts
// app.js
// same as before

// service.js
let CONTAINER = Symbol('container');

export default class Service {
  constructor(container) {
    // the container is now set on a symbol-property so that app-devs don't
    // directly access the container. We want app-devs to use the abstraction,
    // which we're aiming to be more ergonamic
    this[CONTAINER] = container;
  }
}

// this is a decorator, and would be used like `@injectService propertyName`
// where target is the class, name would be "propertyName", and descriptor is the
// property descriptor describing the existing "propertyName" on the class that is
// being decorated
//
// For more information on decorators, checkout the above linked decorator plugin
// for babel.
export function injectService(target, name, descriptor) {
  return {
    configurable: false,
    enumerable: true,
    get: function() {
      if (!this[CONTAINER]) {
        throw new Error(`${target.name} does not have a container. Did it extend from Service?`);
      }

      return this[CONTAINER][name];
    }
  }
}

// bot.js
import Service { injectService } from './service';

export default class Bot extends Service {
  @injectService ai;
  @injectService ui;

  begin() {
    let nextMove = this.ai.getMove();

    this.ui.sendKeyPress(nextMove);
  }
}
```

With this approach we can reference each service by name -- but we have a new problem now:
_as a framework developer, how do we ensure that service properties match up to the service classes?_

In the current implementation, we've been arbitrarily assigning values on the `container` object,
`ui`, `ai`, and `bot`. Since this has been in user-space, we've always known what those properties
are on the container.

This is where convention steps in.


As framework / library authors, we can say that services are required to be in the
`services/` folder of your project.

```ts
let container = {};

function bootApp() {
  initializeServices();

  container.bot.begin();
}

function initializeServices() {
  for (let [name, AppSpecificService] of detectedServices) {
   container[name]  = new AppSpecificService(container);
  }
}
```

However, if you're familiar with module-based javascript, you'll noticed that `detectedServices`
needs to _somehow_ be aware of the services in the `services/` folder and know their names.

This is where a CLI, at build-time, can help out our framework at run-time.

In Ember, this step is handled be the [ember-resolver](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-resolver)
which then defers to [requirejs](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-resolver/blob/master/addon/resolvers/classic/index.js#L16),
which [defines modules](https://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#define) in the [AMD](https://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html#namedmodules)
format -- which, for now, we don't need to worry about.

For demonstration purposes, we'll "say" that our bundler and CLI are configured
together to produce a map of relative file paths to modules:
```ts
let containerRegistry = {
  'services/bot': await import('./services/bot'),
  'services/ai': await import('./services/ai'),
  'services/ui': await import('./services/ui'),
}
```

so then our `app.js` may look like this:
```ts
let knownServices = Object.entries(containerRegistry);
let container = {};

function bootApp() {
  initializeServices();

  container.bot.begin();
}

function initializeServices() {
  for (let [fullName, ServiceModule] of knownServices) {
    let name = fullName.replace('services/', '');
    let DefaultExport = ServiceModule.default;

    container[name]  = new DefaultExport(container);
  }
}
```

So now in our documentation, we can write that whatever the file name of the service is
will be the name of the property pointing to an instance of that service within
the `container`.


Now, what if we wanted our services to be lazily instantiated, so that we don't negatively
impact the _time to interactive_ benchmark if we don't have to?

So far our `container` has been a plain old object. We can utilize a [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy)

```ts
let knownServices = Object.entries(containerRegistry);
let registry = {};

let container = new Proxy(registry, {
  get: function(target, propertyName) {
    if (target[propertyName]) {
      return target[propertyName];
    }

    let FoundService = lookupService(propertyName);

    target[propertyName] = new FoundService(container);

    return target[propertyName];
  }
});

function lookupService(serviceName) {
  let serviceModule = Object.entries(knownServices).find((serviceInfo) => {
    let [ servicePath, serviceModule ] = serviceInfo;

    let name = servicePath.replace('services/', '');

    if (serviceName === name) {
      return serviceModule;
    }
  });

  if (!serviceModule) {
    throw new Error(`The Service, ${serviceName}, was not found.`);
  }

  return serviceModule.default;
}

function bootApp() {
  // initialization now happens on-demand
  container.bot.begin();
}
```

## What does Ember do behind the scenes?

Ember abstracts nearly all of the above from you and provides conventions for
building out the map of service names to service instances, accessing those
services, and creating _any_ container aware-object.

The most important thing to know about the container, is that it'll
provide the contained, known internally-to-ember as the "owner", as
the first argument to each of your classes.

So, if you want to have your own "kind" of object, maybe it's a bunch of custom
objects that interact with something external, such as an API, or a Canvas, or WebGL,
or .. really anything!, it's possible to _register_ your objects with Ember's
container.

Ember does this internally for Services, Routes, Controllers, Components, Helpers,
and Modifiers, but to do what ember is doing, have this somewhere in your app

```js
// maybe in a Route's beforeModel hook
let owner = getOwner(this);
owner.register(
  /*
    full name in the format:
    namespace:name
  */
  'webgl:renderer',
  /* class */
  Renderer
);
```

Now, how would you access that from your component? It's not a service, so the
service decorator wouldn't work. First, let's look at what the service decorator _does_ look like

```js
// abridged version of the @service decorator
//
//
// NOTE: ember convention is:
//   import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';
export function inject(target, name, descriptor) {
  return {
    configurable: false,
    enumerable: true,
    get: function() {
      let owner = getOwner(this);

      return owner.lookup(`service:${name}`);
    }
  }
}
```

So that way, when you have `@service api`, the _namespace_ gets prepending for
you, and the `service:api` _full name_ is looked up in the container.

Knowing the above, we can make our own decorator so that we may access the our
"foo" singleton


```js
export function webgl(target, name, descriptor) {
  return {
    configurable: false,
    enumerable: true,
    get: function() {
      let owner = getOwner(this);

      return owner.lookup(`webgl:${name}`);
    }
  }
}
```

So then _anywhere_ in our app, we could have a component with the following:

```js
class MyComponent extends Component {
  @webgl renderer;
}
```



## "That's all, folks!"

Once I realized the implementation of ember's dependency injection, it felt
simple. It's pretty much a _global store_ where instances of classes are
stored on that _global store_ and referenced from other places within your app.
If something here _doesn't_ feel simple, let me know!, and hopefully I can tweak
this blog post until it does feel simple.

I like the pattern a lot, because it avoids the need to explicitly pass references
to every object you want to use throughout your entire app. Instead, Ember abstracts
away the passing of the container object to all objects created through that container
(mostly components and services, but custom classes can be used as well).

## Disclaimers

Dependency injection can be a big topic and have a lot of features implemented.
This demonstration has narrow scope and is not intended to be a "fully featured"
dependency injection implementation.

## About

Professionally, I had my start to frontend development in React, and at the time
there was really only Redux and MobX for state management -- but I only had the
privilege of working with Redux and eventually React's Context Provider/Consumer
pattern. There _is_ a little bit of overlap between React's Contexts and Ember's
Services, but they differ in fundamental ways -- which could be a topic for
another time.

Now that I'm getting paid to work with Ember almost every day I've only
gotten more excited about the programming patterns introduced by the framework and
am eager to share them with the world.
